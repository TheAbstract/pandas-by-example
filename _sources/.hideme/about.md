# pandas by example

Inspired by chrisalbon's old site (which he deleted and no longer hosts).
- https://github.com/chrisalbon/chrisalbon_com_old [repo has also been deleted]

similar to other 'x by example' sites, but focusing on a tool rather than a language.

for example:
- https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/ - for x by example ideas
- https://github.com/mmcgrana/gobyexample https://gobyexample.com - code here apparently is not idiomatic go
- similar but not the same thing https://github.com/quangvinh1986/pandas-by-example
- similar but not the same thing https://github.com/frankligy/pandas_by_examples


##Â todo

- [ ] pandas-by-example [mvp replicating official tutorial] <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html>

- [ ] add note about GroupBy objects 
> "This grouped variable is now a GroupBy object. It has not actually computed anything yet except for some intermediate data about the group key df['key1']. The idea is that this object has all of the information needed to then apply some operation to each of the groups." - Python for Data Analysis
- [ ] has embedded editor https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/format/theme/editor.html, is there a way to do this with jupyter-book?
- [ ] how to update footer

## to publish

- https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/publish.html

- in a separate branch `gh-pages` put contents of `_build/html`

```
rm *.ipynb _config.yml _toc.yml intro.md
mv _build/html/* .
rm -rf _build/
```


jb walkthrough:
- (basics)[https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/start/overview.html]: write, build, publish.
- use separate branches for source (main) vs build (gh-pages).
- chapters organised as separate files.
